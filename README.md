# Bloom filter

This project implements a Bloom filter and is written as an UI+REST learning experience. A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure which tells us whether an element is definitely not in the set or may be in the set.

# Setup server and client

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/saicharanp/BloomFilter.git
$ cd server
$ npm install
$ npm start 
$ cd client
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
