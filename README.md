# Bloom filter

This project implements a Bloom filter and is written as an UI+REST learning experience. A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure which tells us whether an element is definitely not in the set or may be in the set.

## Code 
This code is fundamentally divided into two parts:
  ### Client
    1) It is the frontend part of the application. 
    2) Implemented using React, Redux, Material UI. 
    3) Runs on the webpack dev server.
    
  ### Server
  1) It is the backend API part of the application. 
  2) Implemented using Express and Node js. 
  3) Runs on the express dev server.


## Setup server and client

$ git clone https://github.com/saicharanp/BloomFilter.git

$ npm install
$ npm start

$ npm start
```
